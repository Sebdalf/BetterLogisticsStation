Forked from [original mod by r0uv3n](https://thunderstore.io/c/dyson-sphere-program/p/r0uv3n/BetterLogisticsStations/).

# BetterLogisticsStations

This mod provides configurations to adjust the number of slots (also called the MaxItemKinds) and the capacity per item (also called the MaxItemCount) of the planetary and interstellar logistics stations.

By default the capacities are the same as in Vanilla DSP, but the slot count is set to 6 for both the planetary and the interstellar logistics stations. Also, the slot count should *not* be set to more than 6, because the UI is not equipped to handle that many slots (I might try to patch this later, so slot counts up to 12 could be used).

When loading the mod, only newly placed stations will have the new slot counts, but all stations will have the new capacity. Reduce the capacity on existing save files at your own risk (you might lose items)!
